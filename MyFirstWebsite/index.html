<h2>Junior Developer To Be</h2>
<p>I am a religious studies graduate, who went through several areas of HR, including scheduling and IT recruitment, and who has decided to engage in the exciting journey to become a junior developer. Quite an unreal path, right?</p>
<p>I never thought that it would be possible for me to go into IT, because of my background in humanities, yet here I am today, looking forward to the journey and curious about the future :)</p>
